\f0\fs24 \cf0 VProbes is a safe, dynamic technology for transparently instrumenting a powered-on guest operating system, its currently running processes, and VMware's virtualization software. VProbes provides both dynamically and statically defined probes. You can find more detailed documentation for VProbes at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/developer/forums/vprobes"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 community website}}.\

\cf0 This Toolkit provides an interactive, programmer-friendly interface to VProbes. It allows you to write instrumentation scripts using a C-like high-level language called Emmett which is a replacement for the more primitive VP language native to VProbes. In a few steps, the installer will copy the binaries and utility scripts to /usr/local/bin.\
